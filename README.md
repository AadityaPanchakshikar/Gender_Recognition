Quick OpenCV Exploration ðŸš€

This project was completed in about 30 minutes as part of my journey to dive into the world of computer vision. The main goal was to get hands-on experience with one of the most popular Python Computer Vision librariesâ€”OpenCV.

I wanted to explore what the buzz was all about, and I have to say, it was a fantastic experience implementing it! OpenCV's flexibility and power have definitely convinced me that it's going to be a key tool in my future projects.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects using OpenCV!
